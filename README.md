<h1>Brick Breaker (web)</h1>
This is the code for my Computer Networks project.
It is an implementation of the famous game which goes by many names (the most popular are Breakout, Brick Breaker, Arkanoid...). 

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The main menu provides access to all the functions of the game: login/registration, playing, information on the original game, leaderboards.</li>
  <li>The game supports user registration and login to enable saving scores once the game is over. Registration can be requested starting from the login page.</li>
  <li>It is possible to check the leaderboard, where the top scores will be displayed along with the user that reached them.</li>
  <li>Having an account is not necessary to play and check the leaderboards, but without logging in you will not be able to save your score once the game is over.</li>
</ul>
